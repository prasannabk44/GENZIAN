					<h5>Genzian Intelligence</h5>
					<p>
					Genzian had conference calls with the HR and IT Managers and explained that as much as they wanted the role to be platform-agnostic, there has to be some motivation for the candidates to want to be in that environment. To start with they need to know what they are currently dealing with before they build out an internal platform. At the first level of conversation, the IT Manager began describing the need as a Database Developer who does ETL work. Again, ETL work today is achieved by tools like SSIS on SOL Server or, Informatica on Oracle. The IT Manager soon realized that these SSIS and Informatica Developers weren't working out either. By the 2nd conference call, we narrowed it down to core ANSI SQL The Manager was looking for candidates that could build ETL work using Dom SOL queries and complex SQL statements. She was not looking for an ETL Developer as we currently see in Informatica or SSIS because they use the features of the platform rather than writing core SQL code. This is why she was trying to present a platformFilled in 41 days of staring week with the client on this position, that includes the time on-agnostic role in the first place.</p>

					<h5>Mutual Solution:discussion. Genzian Intelligence, revision, submissions, internees and offer. Quality of Candidate Increased by</h5>
					<p>
					Our advice was to rmultiple folds.e-write the role as a Core SQL Developer. Also, must mention what is their current data-source and what is their target data-repository. Continue to mention the level of core SQL statements required, not just SELECT and DELETE statements, but more complex aggregate functions. Also, avoiding too much work on stored- procedures and triggers, but those could be an ideal compromise if needed.</p>
